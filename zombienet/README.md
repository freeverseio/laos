# Zombienet

The [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) configuration is located in the `native.toml` file.

Zombienet uses environment variables in the `native.toml` configuration file for easy customization. You can define these variables in your shell before running the commands. 

## How to

**Download Zombienet**
