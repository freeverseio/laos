# LAOS Ownership Parachain

For an in-depth understanding of the LAOS system, refer to the [LAOS Technical Whitepaper](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-whitepaper/blob/main/laos.pdf), which covers all components extensively.

The LAOS Ownership Parachain is a specialized chain built on Polkadot. 

It offers several functionalities that enable the management and transfer of LAOS native utility tokens, as well as the ownership of all LA (Living Assets) created directly within LAOS. Additionally, the Parachain handles the runtime upgrades and stores state roots of Evolution Chains (Evochains), providing asset attribute certification methods and rewarding Evochain validators upon receiving new correct roots. 

## Run your own Node

You can start and sync ownership node locally with the following command:
```
$ docker run freeverseio/laos-ownership-node:<release> --chain=arrakis
```
