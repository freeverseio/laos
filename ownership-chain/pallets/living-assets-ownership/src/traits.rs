/// A collection is a container for non-fungible assets, uniquely identified by a `collection_id`. The system allows
/// for the creation and ownership management of these collections.

/// # Methods
///
/// - `owner_of_collection`: Retrieve the owner of a specified collection.
/// - `create_collection`: Create a new collection and assign it to an owner.
