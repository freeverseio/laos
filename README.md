> **NOTE**: To streamline our development process and encourage diverse contributions, we've consolidated three core projects—Ownership Chain, Evolution Chain, and Bridge—into this single monorepo.

## Introduction

The LAOS Monorepo is the centralized codebase for LAOS, a next-generation, non-custodial, dynamic NFT (Non-Fungible Token) protocol. With the aim of redefining the NFT landscape, LAOS introduces unique features such as universal minting and dynamic asset evolution. This monorepo houses all the essential resources and documentation needed for building and deploying assets on the LAOS blockchain platform.

## Core Projects

### [Ownership Chain](./ownership-chain/)

Ownership Chain is dedicated to the enforcement and management of asset ownership within the LAOS ecosystem. It ensures secure, transparent, and efficient tracking of asset ownership changes, serving as a cornerstone of the LAOS platform.

### [Evolution Chain](./evolution-chain/)

Evolution Chain is engineered to provide dynamic capabilities to NFTs. It enables assets to evolve and adapt over time, based on either pre-defined rules or real-time external factors. This adds a life-like quality to NFTs, making them more engaging and valuable.

### [Bridge](./bridge/)

The Bridge module acts as the communication layer between the Ownership Chain and Evolution Chain, allowing for seamless data exchange and functionality integration.
