# Block Rewards Source Pallet

## Overview

This pallet provides a robust framework for managing the sources of rewards dedicated to block producers in a blockchain network. It enables the configuration and management of reward sources without dictating the specific logic for distribution, thus allowing for seamless integration with existing reward distribution mechanisms. This flexibility ensures that block producers are adequately incentivized for their contribution to the network's security and functionality.

## Features

- **Configurable Reward Sources**: Facilitates the management of different funding sources for block rewards, including but not limited to transaction fees, external contributions, and reserved funds.
- **Transparency in Funding**: Enhances the visibility into the funding mechanisms for block rewards, promoting trust and auditability within the network.
- **Decoupled Distribution Logic**: Allows for the flexible allocation of rewards to block producers by managing reward sources independently from the distribution strategy.
