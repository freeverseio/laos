# How to use multisig accounts

This guide explains how to use multisig accounts in Caladan.

## What is a multisig account?

A multisig account is an account that requires multiple signatures to approve a transaction. This is useful for security reasons, as it means that no single person can approve a transaction on their own. It is also useful for organizational reasons, as it means that multiple people can be involved in the approval process.

More about multisig accounts in Polkadot can be found [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-multisig#introduction-to-multisig-accounts).

## Pre-requisites

We will be using a local Zombienet network to demonstrate:

1. Create a multisig account
2. Change sudo key to a multisig account
3. Approve a transaction with a multisig account

## Launch a local Zombienet network

Follow the instructions [here](../ownership-chain/zombienet/README.md) to launch a local Zombienet network.
